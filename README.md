# DOTA2Analysis
An analysis of different factors that affect the meta in DOTA 2 updates and patches

Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online game developed by Valve that pits two teams of five players each.  Each player picks one character, or hero, (two players can’t play the same character, regardless of team) from a pool of 110+ characters with the goal of destroying the opposing team’s base.

This analysis is to be able to identify and analyze the changing game metas and be able to provide a framework to inform designers on what subsequent updates need to focus on.

One of the things that influence game updates the most, in a MOBA such as DOTA 2 is…
**Game META**

## What is a META?
The metagame (also called the meta) is the current trend that is often considered to be the optimal way to play the game by the community. 
This always changes over time, and is driven by community opinion, professional players, and balance patches.

## What are some of the important QUESTIONS for a designer when it comes to the game meta?
* How often do we need to help shift the meta?
* Is the game getting stale for our player base?
* Can we think of introducing a new element in the game that will have effects in the meta?
* A new hero, perhaps?
* Can we modify the existing elements of the core game mechanics (excluding those concerning monetization) that will cause a shift in the meta?
* Is the current and most popularly chased meta something desirable from a game functionality perspective?

## How can we CLASSIFY each major game update?
* Map changes
* Item additions or changes
* Hero Rebalances
* New Hero addition
* Game mechanics changes
* Rubber banding / anti rubber banding
* Counter balances to major patches (Minor updates usually)
* Bug Fixes (Minor updates usually)

## So, what VARIABLES can encapsulate the response of the designer’s questions?
* Game characteristics
  * Rubber banding (rate of matches with comebacks)
  * Increase in hero synergies, win rates, etc.
  * Increase in item usage
  * Increase or Decrease of heroes played in Captain’s mode*
  * Increase or Decrease of heroes (not available in Captain’s mode) being played in other modes*
