# DOTA2Analysis
An analysis of different factors that affect the meta in DOTA 2 updates and patches

Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online game developed by Valve that pits two teams of five players each.  Each player picks one character, or hero, (two players can’t play the same character, regardless of team) from a pool of 110+ characters with the goal of destroying the opposing team’s base.

This analysis is to be able to identify and analyze the changing game metas and be able to provide a framework to inform designers on what subsequent updates need to focus on.

One of the things that influence game updates the most, in a MOBA such as DOTA 2 is…
**Game META**

## What is a META?
The metagame (also called the meta) is the current trend that is often considered to be the optimal way to play the game by the community. 
This always changes over time, and is driven by community opinion, professional players, and balance patches.
